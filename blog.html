    <h1>🐝 A Honeybee Attack at Cautley Bhawan</h1>

    <p>
        Like every other day, I was returning from the gym, already thinking about breakfast, when something unusual caught my attention.
        A boy was running across the courtyard, frantically trying to brush something off his head.
        At first, I couldn’t understand what was happening.
        Then I noticed the movement around him — bees.
    </p>

    <p>
        To confirm my suspicion, I asked the lady at the canteen what was going on.
        She calmly told me that it was indeed a honeybee attack.
        Strangely, she added that people nearby were moving normally, so she wasn’t sure why the boy was running so desperately.
    </p>

    <p>
        Usually, after the gym, I head straight to the mess for breakfast.
        But today felt different.
        I thought, “Let’s skip breakfast for now. I’ll go back to my room and return later once things settle down.”
    </p>

    <p>
        As I turned toward my room, I suddenly heard it — a sharp, unsettling buzzing sound behind me.
        Within seconds, I realized some bees were following me.
        My heart started pounding.
        I didn’t look back.
        I just ran as fast as I could.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I finally reached a safer distance, a few students noticed my situation and helped me shoo away the bees that had clung to my jacket.
        That moment of relief felt priceless.
    </p>

    <p>
        I rushed back to my room, trying to process what had just happened — and then it hit me.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the first time ever, I had forgotten my keys in the gym.
    </p>

    <p>
        I just stood there thinking, “Damn. What now?”
    </p>

    <p>
        I called the security guard of Cautley Bhawan.
        He told me he had also been attacked.
        Apparently, experts were already working on handling the situation.
        He asked me to wait for about thirty minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
        After waiting — and mentally replaying the entire episode — I finally went back to the gym, retrieved my keys, and then, at last, had my breakfast.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was one hell of an experience.
    </p>

    <p>
        I used to have a dog phobia.
        Now, it seems I might have developed a bee phobia as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        But beyond the fear, the incident forced me to think: why do bees attack?
    </p>

    <p>
        My first instinct was simple — defense.
        Like most living beings, they probably sense danger and react to protect themselves.
        Later, when I searched online, I discovered something fascinating: honeybees can sting only once.
        After that, they die.
    </p>

    <p>
        In protecting their colony, they sacrifice themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nature has its own harsh but powerful logic of survival.
